# lll. Explanation of how Python concepts, libraries, etc. were applied
## Classes and Objects
1.1. The system leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to define entities such as Player, Match, and Tournament.

1.2. Each entity is modeled using a class, encapsulating attributes and behaviors. For instance:
- The Player class stores player information (ID, name, age, rank, country, and gender).
- The Match class stores details of a match, including the players and the winner.
- The Tournament class stores tournament details and manages the matches within the tournament.

## Methods and Functionality
2.1. Methods within each class perform specific actions like adding a match to a tournament (add_match()), updating player details (update_player()), or displaying gender statistics (show_gender_statistics()).

2.2. Functions like get_player_by_id() and get_tournament_by_id() are used to retrieve specific objects from lists by ID, showcasing how functions and iteration work together.

## Input Validation and Error Handling
3.1. The system employs input validation using while loops and try-except blocks to ensure correct data is entered for numeric fields such as age, rank, and match ID.

3.2. This prevents runtime errors and guides the user to input data in the correct format, improving the user experience.

## Data Storage
4.1. he system uses lists (self.players, self.tournaments, self.matches) to store collections of Player, Tournament, and Match objects.

4.2. This allows the system to dynamically manage multiple players, tournaments, and matches. The use of lists facilitates easy iteration over objects to display data or apply operations, such as viewing all players or finding a player by ID.

## String Formatting
5.1 Python’s **f-string formatting** is used to generate formatted output, ensuring that details about players, matches, and tournaments are displayed neatly.

## Control Flow
6.1. The **while loop** is used in multiple places to repeatedly prompt the user for input until valid input is received (e.g., entering a valid player ID, rank, or age).

6.2. **If-else statements** are used to check user choices from the menu and navigate between different options, such as adding a player or viewing matches.

## User Interaction
7.1. The input() function is extensively used to interact with the user, accepting input for player details, match results, and other actions like adding tournaments or players. It also serves as the main method to accept user choices for navigating the system.

7.2. The print() function is used throughout the program to provide output to the user, displaying information about players, tournaments, matches, and statistics.

# IV. SDG 3 Gender Equality
Badminton Player Management System contributes **SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being)** by promoting a healthy and active lifestyle through badminton
- **SDG 3** focuses on promoting good health and well-being for all at all ages. The Badminton Player Management System helps in achieving this by encouraging physical activity and sports participation

**Encouraging Physical Activity**
- Badminton, being a physically demanding sport, promotes cardiovascular health, physical fitness, and general well-being. The system helps in managing players and tournaments, thus facilitating more opportunities for players to compete and stay active.

**Supporting Healthy Competition**
- The system organizes tournaments and matches, which can inspire individuals to lead active lives and engage in regular physical exercise, helping in the prevention of chronic diseases.

**Fostering Mental Well-Being**
- Sports like badminton not only improve physical health but also contribute to mental well-being. Engaging in sports can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, and the system provides a platform to manage and encourage participation in such activities.
